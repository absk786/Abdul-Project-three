## Usage
The application allows the user to purchase tickets to thier favourite football games in europe. 
### User Story:
```
AS a avid football fan,
I WANT to easily and safely be able to browse football tickets for the teams i like
SO THAT I can add items to my cart for checkout.
```
### Acceptance Test for User Story: 
```
GIVEN an e-commerce website, 
WHEN I open the site,
THEN I am able to see the app’s name, logo, and content. 
WHEN I click on “Create an Account”,
THEN I am directed to creating a new account which will later be saved. 
IF I click the “Sign In’ button and did not previously make an account, 
THEN I will not be able to access any account. 
IF I do not enter a valid username or password,
THEN I will also be unable to access any account. 
WHEN I click on the “Sign In” button and do already have an account, 
THEN I can sign into a previously made account and view saved items. 
IF I chose to browse the website without creating an account, 
THEN I can continue to browse and add items to my cart without creating an 
account. 
BUT I will not be able to proceed to the checkout unless I make an account. 
WHEN I go through the application’s inventory, 
THEN I have the ability to view items based on genre or trending selections 
and see available records for purchase. 
WHEN I click on a club, 
THEN I am given the option to view the tickets for the upcomming matches for the club
WHEN I click on a match, 
THEN I will be shown the available tickets in different areas for that matches. 
WHEN I select on my cart, 
THEN I am able to view the items I have saved for checkout and proceed 
with the order. 
WHEN I go through my cart,
THEN I am able to see my saved items in a list and a total price for all items.
IF I have not placed any items in my cart,
THEN if I click on my cart, it will tell me that it is empty. 
WHEN I navigate through the application on a tablet or smartphone,              
THEN the application is still responsive, and I can still view and save records 
to my cart.
